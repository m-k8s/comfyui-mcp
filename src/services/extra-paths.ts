 * other filesystem-backed tool (download_model, model lookups, node_pack (action:"verify"),
 * install_comfyui (action:"environment")) already uses — so this file can never disagree with them about where
 * ComfyUI lives. That order is:
 *
 *   1. `config.comfyuiPath` — COMFYUI_PATH env or auto-detection (wins), then
 *   2. the SAVED DEFAULT WORKSPACE (workspace action:"set_default"), local mode only.
 *
 * Before #648 this read `config.comfyuiPath` DIRECTLY, so with COMFYUI_PATH unset
 * `list_local_models action:"list_paths"` threw while `workspace`/`install_comfyui (action:"environment")` happily reported the
 * saved default workspace — the same install, two different answers.
 *
 * Throws (never guesses) when neither is available, including when the session is not
 * pointed at a local install: reporting some other root's model dirs as if they were the
 * live server's is a wrong-destination hazard, so an explicit unresolved error is the
 * only safe answer.
 *
 * That last clause is stated as a consequence of what `resolveEffectiveComfyUIBase()`
 * returns, not as a guarantee this function independently enforces — the previous
 * wording asserted the guarantee flatly while the resolver did not implement it (#490),
 * and a confident absolute in a comment is precisely what stops the next reader from
 * re-deriving it. If that resolver ever stops refusing, this text is wrong and the check
 * belongs here.
 *
 * STALE-ROOT GUARD (codex rounds 2-3, P1): an INFERRED root — a saved default workspace
 * persisted once and maybe never revisited, or a startup AUTO-DETECTION that has since
 * gone away — has to prove the directory is still THERE before it can be used. Without
 * that check `list_local_models action:"add_path"` would resolve to `<gone root>/extra_model_paths.yaml`,
 * `writeConfigFile`'s recursive `mkdir` would MATERIALIZE the whole vanished tree, and
 * the tool would report "Added … Restart ComfyUI" for a file no ComfyUI will ever read —
 * a silent wrong-destination write. A missing/non-directory inferred root is therefore
 * an explicit error, for READS too: listing a phantom root as an empty config is exactly
 * the authoritative-looking lie this issue is about.
 *
 * An EXPLICIT `COMFYUI_PATH` env var is deliberately NOT gated: that is the user
 * directly naming a root, and its pre-#648 behavior (report `exists:false`, create the
 * dir on write) is left unchanged. `process.env.COMFYUI_PATH` is the discriminator —
 * the same one `getWorkspace()` uses to report `env` vs `auto-detected`.
 *
 * ACCEPTED residual (codex round 3 P2): `statSync` on a saved workspace that lives on a
 * DISCONNECTED UNC share can block for seconds. Not special-cased, because failing
 * closed on `\\server\share` would refuse a perfectly valid NAS install, and the very
 * next steps (`existsSync`/`readFile` on the config file under that same share, which
 * predate this guard) block identically — the guard adds no new class of exposure.

 * `…\AVERYL~1\instance.yaml`" for a file it demonstrably reads (gate round 2, P1) —
 * the disqualifying direction, on the platform this was reported from. `.native` first,

 * unavailable still collapses junctions rather than nothing.
 *
 * `realpath` on the FILE is not enough either, and that gap is not academic: it throws
 * on a path that does not exist, and "does not exist yet" is the ordinary state here —
 * the implicit `<root>/extra_model_paths.yaml` a caller is about to CREATE. In that
 * state the file-level collapse silently degrades to the lexical compare it was added to
 * fix, so a junctioned `COMFYUI_PATH` naming the very file the server reads was declared
 * inert (gate round 1, P1, reproduced with a real Windows junction).
 *
 * So resolve the DIRECTORY and rejoin the basename when the file itself does not
 * resolve. The aliasing that matters lives in the parent — a junctioned/symlinked
 * install root, an 8.3 short name, a mapped drive — and the parent of a config a caller

 * no-op against a file the server never reads (issue #345). Returns the resolved
 * target plus any warning notes to surface. Best-effort: falls back to the
 * static resolveTargetPath when the server is unreachable.
 *
 * A server launched WITHOUT that flag still reads one: ComfyUI auto-loads
 * `<its own main.py root>/extra_model_paths.yaml`. So when the flag is absent but the
 * live root IS derivable from argv, that implicit file is used — it is what the running
 * server reads, and a reachable server is authoritative about that. Without this step a

 * Skipped in remote mode (the live root is a path on the remote host).
 *
 * When argv names its script RELATIVELY and the server reports no cwd — `cd <root> &&
 * python main.py`, and ComfyUI Desktop / the Windows portable bundle's `ComfyUI\main.py`
 * — the argv derivation yields nothing absolute, and every branch below used to refuse a
 * local install that was sitting right there (#1621). That shape is resolved through
 * `resolveLiveServerRoot`'s observed-process tier instead: the same canonical live root
 * (#369) the DOWNLOAD DESTINATION is written into. See the call site for why that tier can
 * only ever add a resolution, never move one.
 *
 * Everything the live server contributes comes from ONE `/system_stats` snapshot, so the
 * launch flags and the install root can never be read from two different server states.
 * And when the server IS reachable but tells us nothing usable — a relative
 * `--extra-model-paths-config` with no reported cwd, or an argv with no `main.py` — the
 * answer is normally an explicit UNRESOLVED, never a quiet fall-through to the local
 * heuristic: a mutation would otherwise report success for a file the running server may
 * not read. `list_local_models action:"list_paths"` is deliberately narrower: when the connected target is
 * already classified LOCAL but its argv simply omits main.py, it may show the known local
 * auto target with an explicit non-authoritative note (#764). Mutations keep refusing that
 * state, so the fallback cannot fabricate a successful edit. `target`/`config_path` remain
 * the deliberate escape hatch, and both short-circuit above this.

 * #1788 — a PINNED target (`target: "desktop"` / `"standalone"` / an explicit

 *
 * What it must NOT keep doing is reporting that edit as though the running server will
 * pick it up. The reporter called `list_local_models action:"add_path" target:"desktop"`
 * on ComfyUI Desktop; the static heuristic wrote
 * `%APPDATA%/ComfyUI/extra_models_config.yaml` and answered "Added … Restart ComfyUI to
 * apply it", while the very same tool's `action:"list_paths"` had already reported the
 * DIFFERENT file the running server was launched with. Two code paths, one question,
 * two answers — and only the one that was right said so. Every live-anchored branch
 * above pushes a divergence note when the STATIC guess would have differed; the pinned
 * branch, which is the direction that actually loses data, pushed none.
 *
 * So: still write where the caller pinned, but ASK the same canonical resolver what the
 * running server reads and disclose the divergence. Deliberately conservative — it can
 * only ever ADD a note:
 *   • the resolver is re-entered with NO pin, so this is the ONE canonical live
 *     resolution, not a second copy of it that could drift (one level of recursion only:
 *     `{}` cannot re-enter this branch);
 *   • anything short of `serverResolved` proof — unreachable, remote, an unproven tree,
 *     the #764 display fallbacks — yields NO note. Silence is the honest answer to "we
 *     could not establish what the server reads";
 *   • an INCOMPLETE loaded set yields no note either (see LiveLoadedConfigs);
 *   • a pinned path that IS one of the server's configs yields no note — a caller
 *     pinning the second `--extra-model-paths-config` file is editing a live one.

 * Takes the SINGLE live `/system_stats` snapshot the caller already used to resolve

 * come from a different server state than the code-root veto (codex inter-snapshot
 * race). Trusted sources, all from that snapshot, so a stale local COMFYUI_PATH /
 * default-workspace config can never authorize an escape:
 *   - every ABSOLUTE `--extra-model-paths-config` file the server was LAUNCHED with
 *     (raw argv values; a RELATIVE flag value is SKIPPED — it can't be resolved to
 *     the live server's file from the MCP process, so trusting it would let a stale
 *     local same-named config authorize; fail closed);
 *   - `<live main.py root>/extra_model_paths.yaml` — ComfyUI's auto-loaded default,
 *     anchored to the server's OWN install root (its main.py dir from argv), NOT an
 *     arbitrary base dir or the local workspace; and
 *   - ComfyUI Desktop's app-data `extra_models_config.yaml`, but ONLY when the
 *     connected snapshot already named a Desktop extra-path config (the generated
 *     `shared_model_paths.yaml` or that same extra_models_config file). Desktop
 *     inventory can list a file from that user extra-path file while argv only
 *     names the shared yaml (#2739). The file is still launch-state-stamped for
 *     deletion. Never guessed from a default :8188 origin.
 *
 * Relative `base_path` / category paths are resolved against the CONFIG FILE's own
 * directory, exactly as ComfyUI resolves them — never against the MCP process CWD —
 * so a same-named/relative config in a stale workspace cannot misattribute a root.
 *
 * Returns `authoritative: false` (and no roots) whenever the server was unreachable,
 * so the caller REFUSES every escaping symlink rather than authorize from a guess.
 *
 * `authoritative` says the roots LISTED can be trusted — it does NOT say they are all
 * the roots this server has. Several paths deliberately drop roots and still return
 * authoritative: a relative `--extra-model-paths-config` we cannot locate, a config
 * that is unreadable or was deleted after the server loaded it, and a group whose
 * `base_path` needs an env var belonging to a separately-launched server. So a caller
 * must NEVER reason from a root's ABSENCE here ("the server registers nothing that
 * could hold these models") — doing that refused a legitimate external-drive install
 * outright (#369). Absence of a root is not evidence; if a future caller genuinely
 * needs that inference it has to be built and TESTED alongside its consumer.
