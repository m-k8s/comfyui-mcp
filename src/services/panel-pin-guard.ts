// The panel version pin, enforced where the PANEL PACK IS IDENTIFIED AS THE
// TARGET — not where the panel-specific entry point happens to be.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The first cut of the pin put its guard inside
// `runPanelAction` and called that "the mutation choke point". It isn't one. The
// panel IS an ordinary custom node pack, so the generic node tools are a second,
// wider door into exactly the same ComfyUI-Manager mutation:
//
//     install_custom_node(action:"update", id="comfyui-agent-panel")
//                                                     → updateCustomNode(...)
//     install_custom_node(action:"update", id="all")  → updateCustomNode(...)
//     install_custom_node(action:"reinstall", id="comfyui-mcp-panel")
//                                                     → reinstallCustomNode(...)
//     update-all                                      → updateAllCustomNodes()
//
// None of those go through `runPanelAction`, so none of them saw the pin. A
// pinned user was one `id="all"` away from being moved. The guard therefore
// lives at the SERVICE layer of the generic mutations, where every caller —
// tools, apply_manifest, dependency installers, anything future — must pass.
//
// This module deliberately imports NOTHING from panel-installer or
// node-management: panel-installer already imports node-management's mutations,
// so a guard that reached back into either would create an import cycle. It
// depends only on the pin store (and panel-recovery, which is itself a leaf over
// config + panel-workspace and reaches back into neither).

 * clean protection while queued work is still out there.
 *
 * Read-back verified like recordPanelPendingOp. A WRITE failure does not
 * settle the answer by itself — writeFileDurable's atomic rename precedes the
 * directory sync, so a directory-sync failure can mean the clear DID land —
 * so the post-state is always READ BACK and the observed state reported
 * (codex gate): claiming "the marker remains" when it is gone would attach a
 * phantom warning to the pin result. Only a READ failure (or a marker still
 * present) returns false, leaving the warning in place. Returns true when the
 * exact record is gone afterwards — including when it was already absent
 * (that is the goal state, not a success claim about work this call did).
