// #1539 — `panel_install_node` took a git `repository` URL for a pack the reporter had
// just found with `panel_search_nodes`, answered `queued: true`, and the Manager queue
// then failed it with
//
//   Node 'comfyui-anima-ipadapter@nightly' not found in
//   [ManagerChannel.dev, ManagerDatabaseSource.cache]
//
// The first pass read that as an UPSTREAM limit — "v4 will not install a repo its
// registry does not list" — and shipped a description saying so. This commit measured
// that claim and it is FALSE for the report's own input.
//
// ## What was measured (2026-08-14, live ComfyUI-Manager V4.2.2 + its own source)
//
// 1. THE PACK IS LISTED. `Wenaka2004/comfyui-anima-ipadapter` is present in the
//    `default` channel's custom-node-list.json (5887 packs) AND in the live rig's own
//    cached copy of it. It is ABSENT from the `dev` channel list (1210 packs). Those
//    two lists are not a superset/subset pair — they share 3 entries.
//
// 2. WE ASKED `dev`. The panel's `buildInstallRequest` defaults the v4 git-URL payload
//    to `channel: "dev"` while defaulting the registry-ID payload — and both 3.x
//    shapes — to `"default"`. The Manager's error names the channel the REQUEST chose.
//
// 3. THE CHANNEL IS WHAT THE LOOKUP READS. `install_by_id` (glob/manager_core.py) for a
//    `nightly` spec does `get_custom_nodes(channel, mode)` → `load_nightly` →
//    `get_data_by_mode(mode, 'custom-node-list.json', channel_url)`, keys that map by
//    the bare repo name (`y.split('/')[-1]`), and clones `the_node['repository']` — the
//    CHANNEL's URL. The `repository` we send is stored in the task params and never
//    read on that path.
//
// 4. REPRODUCED AND ISOLATED on the live V4.2.2 by posting the panel's exact payload to
//    `/v2/manager/queue/task`: `channel:"dev"` → the reporter's error verbatim;
//    `channel:"default"` → the same failure naming `ManagerChannel.default`;
//    `channel:"default", mode:"remote"` → the same again naming `.remote`. The server
//    log shows all three reads landing on the package-BUNDLED node list, because
//    `is_manager_pip_package()` sends `get_data_by_mode` down its offline branch
//    unconditionally: a pip v4 reads the cache file for that exact channel URL or the
//    bundled snapshot, and never fetches. That rig is configured to a non-default
//    channel URL, so it has no `default` cache to hit.
//
// ## What that means for the two remedies the report proposed
//
// ROUTE THE URL THROUGH `install_custom_node` (source:"git") — NOT DONE. That path
// clones into the ORCHESTRATOR's configured ComfyUI; this tool drives whatever ComfyUI
// the PANEL is bound to, and those need not be the same install. Reporting a write into
// an install the running server never reads is a failure this repo has shipped before.
// The tool is still NAMED, with its precondition stated.
//
// REFUSE BEFORE DISPATCH WHEN THE REGISTRY DOES NOT LIST IT — NOT DONE, and this is the
// one the measurement kills. The only registry oracle reachable over the bridge is
// `nodes_search`, and it CANNOT answer this question:
//   - it reads `extension-node-map.json`, a different file from the node list the
//     install resolves against, cached separately and measured stale-by-a-different-
//     amount on the same rig;
//   - it is not channel-scoped at all — `getmappings?mode=cache` and the same route
//     with `&channel=dev` returned byte-identical bodies — so it cannot see the axis
//     that actually decides the outcome;
//   - and against the REPORT'S OWN INPUT it answers "listed", because that search is
//     literally where the reporter got the URL. A guard keyed on it would never have
//     fired on the case it was written for, while reading as good coverage.
//
// So the reply is not corrected by a refusal here. The REQUEST is corrected instead:
// the git-URL route stops asking a channel nobody chose.
