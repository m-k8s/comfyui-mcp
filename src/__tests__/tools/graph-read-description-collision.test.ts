/**
 * #557 — "Show me what is on the canvas right now" was the ONE task 3 of 7 local
 * models got wrong, and they all got it wrong the same way: they dispatched a
 * REAL, semantically adjacent tool (visualize_workflow or panel_query_graph)
 * instead of panel_graph_outline. A valid name means the host dispatches it, so
 * nothing errors — the user just gets something else entirely.
 *
 * Small models weight the OPENING of a description far more than the body, so the
 * property that has to hold is about the first clause, not the paragraph:
 *
 *  1. Every tool in the read-a-graph family opens on a DIFFERENT verb phrase, so
 *     none of them can be picked by matching the same leading words.
 *  2. Exactly one of them — panel_graph_outline — claims the live canvas up front.
 *  3. Every other member explicitly disclaims it BY NAME, so a model that starts
 *     down the wrong path is told where to go instead.
 *
 * Asserting on the leading phrase is deliberate. A test that only checked "the
 * word canvas appears somewhere" passes on the exact wording that shipped the bug.
