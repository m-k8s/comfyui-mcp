/**
 * The eight queue/jobs tools collapsed into one action-parameterized `queue`
 * tool (0.49.0 surface consolidation, slice 4).
 *
 * SHAPE: a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: only `action` can be schema-required — `prompt_id` is required
 * for status/get_workflow/move/edit/cancel_queued, optional for cancel, and
 * meaningless for list/clear, and `position` is required for move but optional
 * for edit. Every VALUE constraint the old tools had is unchanged at the zod
 * layer; the handler enforces per-action presence and names the missing field —
 * the one deliberate behavioural difference a flat enum permits. Each branch
 * calls the same service function the old tool called, with the same arguments,
 * and returns the identical content block (JSON for the query actions, the
 * prose messages for cancel/cancel_queued/clear, isError on a cancel whose
 * outcome no live /queue read settled).

    "Inspect and manage the ComfyUI execution queue. Driven by the `action` parameter:\n" +
      '- action:"list" — The job running now plus all pending jobs, each with its prompt_id and position. Read-only; requires a reachable ComfyUI server (works against local or remote --comfyui-url). Omits queued workflow payloads by default to keep output small; set include_workflows:true when you need to inspect or edit the exact pending payload. Use this before action:"cancel" (running), action:"cancel_queued"/action:"clear" (pending), action:"move", or action:"edit".\n' +
      '- action:"status" — Check ONE job by its prompt_id (the id returned by enqueue_workflow). Queries the connected ComfyUI server; requires it to be running. Returns JSON with running, pending, and done booleans, plus optional status_str, error details, and execution_stats from ComfyUI history once the job is done. If the prompt is neither running nor queued AND /history has no record of it (a restart wipes both), it returns done:false + found:false with an explanatory message — a prompt ComfyUI never executed is NOT a completion, so do not wait for its outputs. Also returns text_outputs when the workflow contained text-preview nodes (Preview as Text, ShowText, …) — those produce no image file, so this is the ONLY way to read their result; report that text back to the user. Use action:"list" to see the whole queue at once, and get_history for full output filenames.\n' +
      `- action:"wait": BLOCK until ONE job (by prompt_id) reaches a TERMINAL state, then return its explicit verdict and outputs. This is how a NON-panel MCP client (e.g. Claude Code) gets a run's result: the panel's auto-notification only reaches the panel's OWN agent, and MCP has no server push, so poll-free waiting needs this call. Loops on the same status source as action:"status" (default timeout 300s, hard cap ${JOB_WAIT_HARD_CAP_S}s, so it can never hang). Returns JSON: state ("success"/"error"/"cancelled"/"interrupted"), found, done, timed_out, waited_s, execution_stats when available, error details on a failed run (NEVER silent about failure), and outputs (a {filename, subfolder, type} list per node, ready to feed straight to get_image action:"get"). If the prompt is neither running, queued, nor in /history (a restart wipes both) it returns found:false at once instead of waiting: a prompt ComfyUI never executed is NOT a completion. If timed_out is true the run is still in progress (not failed); call again or check action:"status". For MANY jobs at once use batch action:"wait".\n` +
      '- action:"get_workflow" — The full workflow payload for one PENDING queue item by prompt_id. Read-only. Does not work for the currently running job because ComfyUI cannot safely edit a job after execution starts.\n' +
      '- action:"move" — Move a PENDING queue item to the front or back by removing it and re-enqueuing its saved workflow payload; `position` ("front"|"back") is required. The job receives a NEW prompt_id; the old prompt_id is removed. Running jobs cannot be moved.\n' +
      '- action:"edit" — Edit a PENDING queue item by removing it and re-enqueuing an updated workflow. Provide either a complete replacement `workflow` or `node_inputs` patches keyed by node id; `position` selects where to requeue (default back). The job receives a NEW prompt_id; the old prompt_id is removed. Running jobs cannot be edited.\n' +
      '- action:"cancel" — Stop the CURRENTLY RUNNING job ROBUSTLY. Sends an interrupt, then WAITS and verifies the job actually stopped — ComfyUI only honors interrupts BETWEEN steps, so a long single step (e.g. a high-res video sampler) can ignore a plain cancel. If the interrupt isn\'t honored it escalates to freeing VRAM (POST /free) and re-checks; if it STILL won\'t die it reports the job as WEDGED and tells you to restart_comfyui (an HTTP cancel cannot kill a stuck step). Set clear_pending:true to also drop ALL pending jobs in the same call — the correct "reset the queue" action, since cancelling alone leaves pending jobs that would run next. The partial result is discarded. With `prompt_id` given, only interrupts the running job when its prompt_id matches; omit to interrupt whatever is currently running. Use action:"cancel_queued" to remove one specific PENDING job instead.\n' +
      '- action:"cancel_queued" — Remove one specific PENDING job from the queue by prompt_id, then VERIFY the removal against a live /queue read on both sides of it. Only PENDING jobs can be removed this way: ComfyUI silently ignores the request for a job it has already started, so if the job won the race and is now RUNNING this reports isError and tells you the outputs will still be delivered — use action:"cancel" to interrupt that. Also reports isError when the prompt_id was not in the queue at all (it already finished, or was never queued) rather than calling that a removal.\n' +
      '- action:"clear" — Clear ALL pending jobs from the queue. Does not affect the currently running job.',
