 * checks (paid-API-node classification, custom-node dependency resolve/install).
 *
 * SHAPE: a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: only `action` can be schema-required — `name` is required for
 * read_workflow/skill_read and meaningless elsewhere, `workflow` is required for
 * extract_deps/install_deps, `source` for generate_skill. Every VALUE constraint
 * the old tools had is unchanged at the zod layer (`name` keeps its `.min(1)`);
 * the handler enforces per-action presence and names the missing field — the one
 * deliberate behavioural difference a flat enum permits. Each branch calls the
 * same function the old tool called, with the same arguments, and returns the
 * identical content block (including generate_skill's `structuredContent`).
 *
 * MUTATION — TWO actions can change the user's machine, and neither may be a
 * surprise under a tool whose name reads like a listing:
 *
 *   action:"install_deps" INSTALLS custom-node packs through ComfyUI-Manager on
 *   the connected server, which downloads and RUNS third-party code. It is the
 *   only action that installs anything, and the switch below is the only route
 *   to that service.
 *
 *   action:"generate_skill" WRITES TO DISK on every cache MISS — the generated
 *   SKILL.md is persisted into its read-through cache under the user's home
 *   (~/.comfyui-mcp/skill-cache, or COMFYUI_SKILL_CACHE_DIR) — and, when the
 *   caller passes `install_in`, ALSO creates that directory recursively and
 *   overwrites any SKILL.md in it. Both writes are exactly what its retired
 *   standalone tool did. "Read-only unless install_in" would be an overclaim:
 *   the cache write is unconditional on a miss and lands in configurable
 *   user-home state.
 *
 * The other eight actions read. Both mutations are stated in their own
 * description bullets, because a read-only-looking tool that quietly installs or
 * overwrites is a wrong-expectation defect — and so is a safety note that
 * undercounts them.

SCOPE LIMIT: this endpoint does NOT include ComfyUI\'s own core bundled templates from the comfyui-workflow-templates package (e.g. "Flux.1 Inpaint") — those are served to the frontend as static assets via a separate code path this action cannot see, so a small/empty result here does NOT mean no official template exists, only that no custom-node pack contributed one. When asked to "set up / build a <model-family> workflow", check here for a custom-node-contributed starter AFTER checking the bundled skills + installer packs (action:"skill_list" / action:"list"), and also tell the user to check the ComfyUI frontend\'s own Templates browser directly for core templates, since this action cannot enumerate those. NOTE: this lists what\'s available; loading a template onto the canvas is done in the ComfyUI frontend\'s Templates browser (the panel agent cannot load a template graph headlessly yet) — surface the matching template name to the user.\n' +

Pass `pack` (a bundled pack name — always local/free) OR `graph` (a UI or API/prompt workflow JSON, as object or string).

Maps each node class_type to its owning node pack using ComfyUI-Manager mappings and the server\'s installed node definitions, reporting which packs are installed vs missing.

Resolve and INSTALL the custom node packs a ComfyUI workflow (`workflow`) requires, via ComfyUI-Manager: it determines the missing packs, resets the Manager queue, QUEUES THE INSTALLS, starts the worker, and reports what was installed/already-present/unresolved. Installing a pack downloads and runs third-party code (and may pull large files) on the connected ComfyUI host — local OR remote --comfyui-url — and a ComfyUI restart is typically needed before new nodes load. Use action:"extract_deps" first if you only want to SEE what is missing. Mirrors `comfy-cli node install-deps`.\n' +
      '- action:"skill_list" — List the bundled ComfyUI model-family + workflow skills shipped with comfyui-mcp, plus the user\'s own skills from COMFYUI_MCP_SKILLS_DIRS (name + description + source for each). These encode per-family expertise (e.g. krea2-txt2img: native krea2 CLIPLoader, Qwen3-VL encoder, 8-step turbo settings) and the installer-packs system. Call this BEFORE hand-building a <model-family> workflow from scratch — if a matching skill exists, read its full guidance with action:"skill_read" and prefer a ready installer pack (action:"list") over a generic graph. Claude loads these natively; this action gives the SAME knowledge to any MCP client (e.g. the Codex backend).\n' +
      '- action:"skill_read" — Return the full body of a bundled skill\'s SKILL.md by name (`name`; discover names with action:"skill_list"). Gives you the family\'s complete expertise on demand — model slots, node graph, recommended settings, and gotchas — so you can build the right workflow instead of guessing. Names are validated (no path traversal) and must match an existing skill directory.\n' +
      '- action:"generate_skill" — MUTATING: it WRITES to the read-through skill cache on every cache miss, and when `install_in` is set it ALSO creates that directory and overwrites any SKILL.md in it. Generate a Claude skill (SKILL.md) documenting a ComfyUI custom node pack: its nodes, inputs/outputs, and example workflows. `source` accepts a ComfyUI Registry ID (resolved via api.comfy.org) or a GitHub repository URL. Uses a read-through cache under ~/.comfyui-mcp/skill-cache (override COMFYUI_SKILL_CACHE_DIR); set refresh:true to bypass it. On cache miss, fetches the repo README and scans its Python NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS and example workflows over the network (uses GITHUB_TOKEN if set to avoid rate limits), so internet access is required. If a ComfyUI server is reachable it enriches node input/output types from /object_info, but the server is optional. Returns the SKILL.md markdown with structured cache metadata; if install_in is set, also creates that directory (recursively) and writes SKILL.md there, overwriting any existing file.',
