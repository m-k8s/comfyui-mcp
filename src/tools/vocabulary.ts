 * The mentions of a dead name on one line that are ROT.
 *
 * WHY ANY EXEMPTION EXISTS. For many 0.50.0 folds the natural action name IS the
 * retired tool name. So `regenerate` stops being a tool and becomes an ACTION of
 * `generate_image` — and `deadNameRe` cannot tell those apart, because they are
 * spelled identically. Every remaining use of the token is then flagged, including
 * the migration text the prose sweep is REQUIRED to write:
 *
 *     generate_image (action:"regenerate")
 *
 * Without a rule, no sweep for those names can ever go green. Slice 9 escaped only
 * by RENAMING its actions (`list_skills` → `skill_list`); that does not scale to
 * `apply_manifest` (93 mentions) or `clear_vram` (35), where contorting exactly the
 * names models reach for is a real discoverability regression.
 *
 * THE THREE RULES, each self-derived from the entry and each POSITIONAL:
 *
 *   (a) MIGRATION TARGET — inside a verbatim copy of the entry's own
 *       `replacement`. Covers prose: comments, README rows, docs. Measured at 27
 *       of slice 16's 84 hits.
 *   (b) ACTION VALUE — `action:"regenerate"`, `"action": "regenerate"`,
 *       `args.action === "regenerate"`. Self-evidencing (the text says `action`),
 *       so repo-wide and no ledger entry, which is what keeps `docs:gen` output
 *       stable across regeneration. See actionValueSpans.
 *   (c) ACTION LITERAL — `"regenerate"` as a complete quoted string, ONLY in the
 *       paths the entry lists in `implementedIn`: enum members, `case` labels,
 *       arguments to per-action helpers. See actionLiteralSpans.
 *
 * (b) and (c) require the entry's `replacement` to declare this exact name as an
 * action (`declaredActions`), so a fold that renamed its action gets nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN THE RATCHET. Nothing here is a human-chosen string:
 * (a) is the ledger's own output, (b) is a syntactic form that names itself, (c) is
 * one structural form in explicitly declared files. All of these still fail:
 *
 *   - a bare `regenerate` anywhere, and `call regenerate to redo the render`;
 *   - `some_other_tool (action:"regenerate")` — the WRONG tool. (b) deliberately
 *     skips any match preceded by `<identifier> (`, handing it to (a), which
 *     exempts it only when the tool is the declared survivor;
 *   - `not_generate_image (action:"regenerate")` — a tool whose name merely ENDS
 *     with the survivor's;
 *   - `"Call regenerate now"` in an `implementedIn` file — a quoted string whose
 *     content is not exactly the name;
 *   - a rotten bare mention sharing a line with a legitimate replacement form or
 *     `action:"N"`. Exemption is by span CONTAINMENT, never line-wide.
 *
 * (a) matches LITERALLY (`indexOf`), never a regex built from `replacement`: the
 * replacements are call forms containing `(`, `)`, `"` and `|`, and a pattern
 * compiled from `comfy_cli (action:"a"|"b")` would alternate rather than match.
 *
 * Entries whose replacement does not contain their own name — the large majority,
 * and every entry in the ledger today — are byte-for-byte unaffected by all three.
 *
 * NOTE for a fold whose replacement names several actions: declare the SAME
 * combined string (`manager (action:"update_all"|"self_update")`) on every entry it
 * covers. The rules are per-name and self-derived on purpose, so a name is exempted
 * only against ITS OWN declared target.
 *
 * `path` is the repo-relative file being scanned; omit it and rule (c) is off.

 * The panel calls these names as bare string literals from browser JS and vendors
 * a generated copy of this vocabulary to validate them against. Nothing checks
 * that its copy still matches the server it is talking to. `vocab:export --check`
 * proves the artefact matches THIS repo's ledger; the panel's own gate verifies
 * its vendored file against its own contents. Both are self-consistency checks,
 * and neither can see across the repo boundary.
 *
 * That gap has now cost twice, in both directions. Panel #683: the panel sat at
 * 145 tools while core had finished at 37, and the whole Training tab called
 * names that no longer existed. The mirror case is just as real — a rig running
 * an updated panel against a not-yet-updated server, where the panel calls the
 * consolidated names and the server only answers the old ones. Either way the
 * failure surfaces at CALL time as "unknown tool", which reads to a user as "the
 * panel is broken" and gives an agent nothing to act on.
 *
 * A version string cannot close this: two builds of the same version can carry
 * different vocabularies, and two different versions can carry identical ones.
 * Hashing the vocabulary itself is stable across releases and changes exactly
 * when the thing it identifies changes.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT cover
 *
 * Names only. Schemas, descriptions, annotations and handlers can all change
 * while every name stays identical, and this will read as a match — the same
 * scope `vocab:export` documents for the artefact. It answers "do we agree on
 * what exists", not "do we agree on what it does".
 *
 * MUST stay byte-identical to the artefact's `vocabularyHash`, so
 * scripts/export-vocabulary.mts calls THIS function rather than repeating the
 * expression. Two copies of a hash rule drift, and a handshake that compares a
 * drifted hash reports a mismatch that is not real — worse than no check.
 */
/**
 * The hash of THIS server's vocabulary — the value the panel handshake compares
 * against (#236).
 *
 * The panel tool names arrive as an argument rather than being imported, and that
 * is load-bearing: `buildPanelToolDefs` lives in orchestrator/panel-tools.ts, which
 * imports ui-bridge, which would make importing it here a cycle. Passing them in
 * keeps this module free of the orchestrator entirely.
 *
 * ## Why the ASSEMBLY lives here and not at each call site
 *
 * `computeVocabularyHash` hashes whatever it is handed; deciding WHAT to hand it —
 * core names, panel names SORTED, dead names — is a second rule, and it was
 * previously written out only in scripts/export-vocabulary.mts. A runtime check
 * that assembled its own copy would agree with the artefact right up until one of
 * the two changed, and then report a mismatch that is not real. The doc on
 * `computeVocabularyHash` says two copies of the hash rule must not exist; this is
 * the same argument applied to its input, which is just as capable of drifting.
 *
 * So the exporter calls this too, and `vocabulary-handshake.test.ts` asserts the
 * value it produces from the live panel defs equals the artefact's own
 * `vocabularyHash` — the only check that can actually catch drift between them.

 * ## Why the message does not name which side is stale
 *
 * It cannot, and guessing would be worse than not saying. Both sides are opaque
 * digests; there is no ordering between two hashes and no history to rank them
 * against. The server knows only that they differ. So the message states exactly
 * that, and gives the one remedy that is correct in both directions — bring both
