/**
 * The install/environment tools collapsed into one action-parameterized
 * `install_comfyui` tool (0.50.0 surface consolidation, slice 13): seven tools,
 * seven actions.
 *
 * The slice originally folded eight. Review took the RFC's documented fallback
 * for `apply_manifest` and left it STANDALONE — it is the most-referenced name
 * on the whole surface (143 in-repo mentions, nearly all of them one-line
 * install INSTRUCTIONS in pack headers, blog posts and the installer-packs
 * skill), and burying the repo's most-taught operation inside a seven-action
 * description cost more than the slot it saved.
 *
 * SHAPE: a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: only `action` can be schema-required — `target_path` is required
 * by action:"install" and meaningless elsewhere, `manager_setting` by
 * action:"configure_manager", and the rest are per-action optionals. Every VALUE
 * constraint the old tools had is unchanged at the zod layer (`target_path`
 * keeps its .min(1), `manager_setting` its enum), and the handler enforces
 * per-action PRESENCE while NAMING the missing field — the one deliberate
 * behavioural difference a flat enum permits. The guards test ABSENCE, never
 * falsiness.
 *
 * THREE FOLDED TOOLS ALREADY HAD AN `action` OF THEIR OWN — the panel install,
 * the self-update and the Manager configuration. Two fields cannot share one name in a flat
 * object, so those sub-selectors become `panel_action`, `self_update_action` and
 * `manager_setting`. That is a rename of a model-facing argument, which a fold
 * otherwise avoids; here it is forced by the shape, and each keeps its enum
 * VALUES and its default verbatim (`panel_action` and `self_update_action` both
 * still default to "status", so the bare action is still the read-only one).
 *
 * `version` is DELIBERATELY shared rather than split: both `install_comfyui` and
 * `install_comfyui(action:'panel')` called their argument `version`, and `action` already says
 * which one is meant. Splitting it would rename an argument that did not have
 * to change.
 *
 * BLAST RADIUS IS NOT UNIFORM, and the description says so per action:
 * action:"install" writes a whole new ComfyUI tree, action:"self_update" mutates THIS
 * npm package, action:"panel" mutates the sidebar node-pack, and action:"update" /
 * action:"update_all" move ComfyUI core and every installed node pack
 * respectively. Nothing here is read-only except action:"environment",
 * panel_action:"status" and self_update_action:"status".

    "install_comfyui",
    "Install, update and configure the local ComfyUI installation, its sidebar panel, and this MCP server itself. Driven by the `action` parameter:\n" +
      '- action:"install" — Install ComfyUI locally: git-clone it into `target_path`, create a dedicated workspace virtualenv (<target>/.venv), and install Python requirements INTO that venv (never the Python running this MCP server) via pip or uv. ComfyUI-Manager is installed from manager_requirements.txt when present, else git-cloned as a fallback. Mirrors `comfy-cli install`. LOCAL, subprocess-only and independent of any remote --comfyui-url target; the target dir must be empty or non-existent (an existing install is never overwritten). Runs SYNCHRONOUSLY and can take several minutes (large git clone + full torch/dependency install); the call blocks until done. On success returns a JSON report { installed, targetPath, venvPath, comfyuiUrl, managerInstalled, managerVia, version, pythonInstaller, steps[] }. Does NOT start ComfyUI. `target_path` is REQUIRED.\n' +
      '- action:"update" — Update the ComfyUI CORE install: runs `git pull` in the connected local server\'s observed checkout (falling back to COMFYUI_CODE_PATH, then COMFYUI_PATH) and reinstalls its Python requirements (auto-detecting uv vs pip). Returns a clear error when targeting a remote instance via --comfyui-url. The requirements install targets the running server\'s own interpreter (recorded when this server launched ComfyUI, or an explicit COMFYUI_PYTHON); when that interpreter cannot be verified the update refuses rather than install into a guessed environment — start ComfyUI or connect first. Does NOT touch custom nodes.\n' +
      '- action:"update_all" — Update ALL installed CUSTOM NODES via the ComfyUI-Manager HTTP API. Mirrors `comfy-cli update all`. This does NOT update ComfyUI core — use action:"update" for that. Works against the connected instance (local or remote); updates run asynchronously and a ComfyUI restart may be required afterward. REFUSED while the comfyui-mcp sidebar panel is version-pinned, because \'all\' would move the pinned panel too and ComfyUI-Manager cannot update everything-except-one-pack — clear the pin with action:"panel" + panel_action:"unpin", or update the other packs individually by id.\n' +
      '- action:"panel" — Install, update, reinstall, sync, pin, unpin, unlock, or report status of the ComfyUI sidebar panel (\'comfyui-agent-panel\' on the Comfy Registry; repo comfyui-mcp-panel) in the LOCAL ComfyUI\'s custom_nodes, selected by `panel_action` (default "status"). Uses the same ComfyUI-Manager path as install_custom_node and always targets the \'nightly\' (git-HEAD) channel. Local-only (no-op/refuses in remote/cloud mode) and NEVER modifies a dev install (a symlinked panel dir). After install/update/reinstall/sync, ComfyUI must be RESTARTED to load the new/updated node — this tool does not auto-restart. The panel is also auto-installed-if-missing when the MCP server loads. A version PIN (panel_action:"pin") holds the panel where it is: while a pin is set, install/update/reinstall/sync and the auto-install all refuse, and \'sync\' only warns that a newer panel exists. Panel operations are serialized across orchestrator processes by a lock file. A lock whose recorded owner process is gone is reclaimed automatically; a living owner\'s lock is never stolen. panel_action:"unlock" RE-CHECKS and reports rather than forcing: it applies that same proof, so it clears the lock only when the recorded owner can be shown dead and REFUSES when ownership cannot be proven (an unreadable record, or a pid indistinguishable from a reused one) — in that case the recovery is manual, after confirming no orchestrator still runs. This is the SIDEBAR PANEL only; it never touches ComfyUI core or this npm package.\n' +
      '- action:"self_update" — Check or apply a self-update of the comfyui-mcp NPM PACKAGE (this MCP server), selected by `self_update_action` (default "status"). The server also auto-checks on start (opt out with COMFYUI_MCP_AUTOUPDATE=0). Detects the install mode: a dev install (npm link / source checkout) is NEVER updated; global/local installs are updated via npm; npx fetches latest on next run. The running process cannot hot-swap its own code — after an update you must RECONNECT (/mcp) or restart the orchestrator to load the new version. This tool does not auto-restart. On Windows the running orchestrator holds its own sharp DLL locked, so an in-place npm replace fails (EBUSY); the update is then handed to a deferred helper that finishes it once the orchestrator has fully stopped, and the new version loads at the next start. A failed update reports npm\'s own error output. This updates comfyui-mcp ITSELF — not ComfyUI (action:"update"), not the sidebar panel (action:"panel"), and not custom nodes (install_comfyui (action:"update_all")).\n' +
      '- action:"environment" — Report ComfyUI environment info (mirrors `comfy-cli env`): the running instance details from /system_stats (OS, Python, ComfyUI version, GPU/VRAM — works for remote targets) plus local probes when a workspace path is available (Python version, git revision, ComfyUI-Manager version, and key pip packages like torch/CUDA). Split installs report `local.workspace_path` for data/base state and `local.code_path` for the serving checkout; git follows the code path and Manager follows the data/base root (`custom_nodes`). The local python probe targets the interpreter the RUNNING server uses (its venv / embedded / standalone python, resolved from the live server), never a bare `python` on PATH. Degrades gracefully and NEVER guesses: when the correct interpreter can\'t be confirmed, `local.python_probe_trusted` is false, `local.packages` is omitted, and `local.python_probe_reason` says why — an absent package list means UNDETERMINED, never \'not installed\'. READ-ONLY.\n' +
      '- action:"configure_manager" — Configure ComfyUI-Manager settings, mirroring `comfy-cli manager` subcommands; `manager_setting` picks which setting and `value` its new value. Most settings use the ComfyUI-Manager HTTP API (works against remote ComfyUI); set_network_mode and set_security_level have no HTTP setter and are written to Manager\'s config.ini (requires a known local ComfyUI path; restart ComfyUI to apply).',
