 * Where get_image action:"get" writes when the caller names no directory (#768).
 *
 * It used to be `process.cwd()`, which is not a location this process chose — it is
 * whatever directory the MCP client happened to launch us from. On Windows that is
 * routinely `C:\Windows\System32`, and the write died with EPERM *after* the image had
 * already been fetched. The schema had always DOCUMENTED `/tmp/comfyui-images/`; the
 * string existed nowhere in the code, and `/tmp` is not a real directory on Windows
 * anyway. `os.tmpdir()` is the platform-correct, process-writable spelling of the same
 * promise (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp` on Windows, `/tmp` on Linux, `$TMPDIR` on macOS).
 *
 * Computed per call rather than at module load so a test (or a caller) that repoints
 * TMPDIR/TEMP is honoured instead of being silently pinned to the value at import time.
 *
 * `os.tmpdir()` returns %TEMP%/%TMP%/$TMPDIR verbatim, and nothing guarantees those are
 * usable as a launch-independent base. Merely `resolve()`-ing a bad one would anchor it
 * to the MCP process's cwd and land us straight back in System32, so an unqualified
 * tmpdir is not used at all: `os.homedir()` is always fully qualified and always writable
 * by us, and the whole point of this function is to name a directory that does not depend
 * on where we were launched.

/**
 * The twelve image/asset tools collapsed into TWO action-parameterized tools
 * (0.50.0 surface consolidation, slice 15):
 *
 *   `get_image`    — the READ/INSPECT surface: fetch, view, browse, re-encode,
 *                    measure colour, and read asset provenance (7 actions)
 *   `upload_image` — the WRITE surface: put bytes somewhere ComfyUI (or cloud
 *                    storage) can read them (5 actions)
 *
 * TWO tools rather than one twelve-action grab-bag because the halves have
 * opposite directions of travel and different blast radii: everything on
 * `get_image` reads (its one write is the local save of bytes it just fetched),
 * while every action on `upload_image` puts a file somewhere — ComfyUI's input/
 * directory or a cloud bucket. The orchestrator's call_tool whitelist depends on
 * that split: `get_image` is whitelisted for canvas-less clients (action-SCOPED,
 * see CALL_TOOL_ACTION_WHITELIST in src/orchestrator/call-tool-admission.ts) and
 * `upload_image` is not whitelisted at all — exactly as before the fold.
 *
 * Both survivors keep their registration slots (get_image, then upload_image),
 * so tools/list order is unchanged for every name that still exists.
 *
 * SHAPE: a FLAT object with an `action` enum — deliberately NOT a
 * z.discriminatedUnion, which the MCP SDK renders as a schema with ZERO visible
 * parameters, hiding every input from the model.
 *
 * REQUIREDNESS: only `action` can be schema-required. `filename` is required for
 * action:"get" but optional for action:"analyze_color" and meaningless for
 * action:"list_assets"; `asset_id` is required for "view"/"asset_metadata" and
 * optional for "convert"/action:"analyze_color"; `format` is required for
 * "convert" and optional
 * for "list_outputs". The handler enforces per-action PRESENCE and names the
 * missing field — the one deliberate behavioural difference a flat enum permits.
 * Guards test ABSENCE, never falsiness: `filename: ""` passed z.string() before
 * this consolidation and reached the service, which answers with its own
 * not-found/validation error, and it still does.
 *
 * WHERE THE BYTES GO: `stage` copies a generated OUTPUT back into ComfyUI's
 * INPUT directory, image/video/audio upload a LOCAL file into that same input
 * directory, and `output` ships a generated output OFF the machine to S3 / Azure
 * / an HTTP PUT / HuggingFace. A cross-wired action would put a file somewhere
 * the caller did not ask for without failing, so upload-image.test.ts pins each
 * action to exactly one service in BOTH directions.
 */

 * The action vocabularies, declared once each.
 *

  server.tool(

    "Fetch, browse and inspect ComfyUI images and registered assets. Driven by the `action` parameter:\n" +
      '- action:"get" — Fetch a generated image from ComfyUI by FILENAME and return it as an inline image. Video/audio outputs (e.g. a VHS_VideoCombine .mp4) and allowlisted mesh/material attachments (.obj, .glb, .gltf, .fbx, .ply, .stl, .mtl) are saved to save_dir with their original extension instead of being rendered inline. Works with remote ComfyUI instances — does not require COMFYUI_PATH. Use get_history (action:"list") first to obtain the filename; if it returns `subfolder/filename`, pass that relative path as-is and get_image will split it automatically.\n' +
      '- action:"view" — Fetch a registered asset\'s bytes by ASSET ID and return them as an inline image so the agent can see the result. Use this after a render completes (asset_id is included in the completion notification) to inspect, critique, or compare generated images. Only supports image mime types (PNG/JPEG/WebP); audio/video assets must be saved to disk via action:"get".\n' +
      '- action:"list_outputs" — List recently generated image AND video files from ComfyUI\'s output/ directory, newest-first, with each file\'s kind (\'image\' | \'video\'), subfolder, size, and modification time. Covers stills (.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.bmp) and video/animation outputs (.mp4/.webm/.mov/.mkv/.m4v/.avi/.gif/.webp). LOCAL ComfyUI (COMFYUI_PATH set): a RECURSIVE filesystem scan of output/ (stills + video, including subfolders like video/ that VHS/SaveVideo write to) AND of temp/ for video files — VHS_VideoCombine with `save_output` unchecked writes the completed .mp4 (including the "-audio.mp4" a run completion names) there; those entries are tagged type:"temp" so action:"get" / upload_image (action:"stage") can fetch them. Reports size + modification time. Preview stills in temp/ (PreviewImage) are omitted. REMOTE ComfyUI: derives the list from /history over HTTP instead (size/modified are unavailable and omitted) and includes type:"temp" videos from history the same way. It does NOT return the media bytes themselves — fetch those with action:"get". USE THIS TO CONFIRM A VIDEO RENDER (e.g. VHS_VideoCombine / LTX / WAN output) when get_history (action:"list") shows the prompt done but lists no output: VHS-style video nodes write the file but often do NOT register in ComfyUI\'s /history, so the local filesystem scan is the reliable way to verify the .mp4 exists — then chain it with upload_image (action:"stage"). THAT GUARANTEE IS LOCAL-ONLY AND INVERTS ON A REMOTE TARGET: with no disk to scan, this falls back to /history, so a REMOTE listing can neither confirm nor deny a VHS video that never registered, and absence from it is NOT evidence the file is missing. Check a specific filename with action:"get" or upload_image (action:"stage") instead — both read /view. Every remote result says so in its own text. Read-only.\n' +
      '- action:"convert" — Re-encode a generated image to PNG, JPEG, or WebP and return it inline as an image content block. Source can be a registered asset_id or a path under the local ComfyUI output directory. Optionally writes the converted image back under the output directory and reports source/output size plus bytes saved.\n' +
      '- action:"analyze_color" — Measure the color of a rendered image (not by eye): returns black/white points, contrast (luma std), saturation, per-channel means + cast, and clipping — plus heuristic flags (washedOut, lowContrast, liftedBlacks, dimHighlights, lowSaturation, colorCast) and a one-line verdict. Source = asset_id, a ComfyUI output ref (filename/subfolder/type), or an image path. Pass reference_path to shot-match against a known-good frame (target−reference deltas). Set histogram:true to also get an overlaid R/G/B/luma histogram PNG. Use this to diagnose \'washed out\' objectively and decide a color fix; for a video, extract a frame to PNG first.\n' +
      '- action:"compare" — Did an edit HAPPEN? Compare the edited image (the usual source) against its BEFORE image (reference_*) pixel by pixel: verdict "unchanged" or "modified" with certainty, share of changed pixels, the changed region, and a change map (red over the dimmed edit). Use it before judging an edit by eye: a workflow that returns its input unchanged (empty mask, strength 0, switch on the wrong side) LOOKS like a success because it is the source image.\n' +
      '- action:"list_assets" — List recently generated assets, newest-first. Each call first reconciles ComfyUI\'s /history, so outputs are listed even when this session did not watch the render complete (e.g. queued via panel_run, by an earlier session, or before a server restart) — those are tagged source:\'history-reconcile\', versus source:\'watched\' for renders this server saw finish. Newly reconciled image refs are checked through /view before registration; stale or unavailable refs are omitted and disclosed in the response note. Returns count + assets (asset_id, prompt_id, filename, url, source, created_at). The registry is ephemeral and clears on server restart; records expire after COMFYUI_ASSET_TTL_HOURS (default 24h), and only the most recent completed runs are reconciled — use get_history (action:\"list\") / action:"get" by filename for anything older.\n' +
      '- action:"asset_metadata" — Get full provenance for a registered asset including the workflow snapshot that produced it. Use this to inspect the parameters that generated an image before calling generate_image (action:"regenerate") with overrides.',

Works for both local and remote ComfyUI. Returns the stored filename.\n' +

Works for both local and remote ComfyUI. Returns the stored filename.\n' +
      '- action:"stage" — Stage an EXISTING ComfyUI output (or temp/preview) as an INPUT so the next stage\'s loader (LoadImage / VHS_LoadVideo / LoadAudio) can read it. This is the CORRECT way to chain a multi-stage pipeline (e.g. Krea2 image → LTX video → WAN extend): it fetches the output\'s bytes from the server via /view and re-registers them as an input via /upload/image — the same endpoints get_image and the uploads above use. Because it goes entirely through the server API, it works even when ComfyUI was launched with a CUSTOM input/output directory. Do NOT instead copy the output file or guess a filesystem `input/` path — the server\'s input dir may be custom and it will reject the file ("Invalid image file"), wasting the render. Pass an existing output reference ({ filename, subfolder?, type? }); the media kind (image/video/audio) is inferred from the extension unless you set `kind`. Nested video as_filename values are staged at the input root because VHS_LoadVideo lists only top-level files. Returns { filename, subfolder, type: "input", kind } — drop `filename` into LoadImage / VHS_LoadVideo / LoadAudio combo widgets. VHS_LoadVideoPath needs the returned filesystem path, not that combo filename ("Invalid file path" otherwise).\n' +
