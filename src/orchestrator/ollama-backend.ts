// Ollama local-LLM adapter for the panel orchestrator (issue #97's panel phase).
//
// Unlike the Claude/Codex/Gemini adapters, the "provider" here is a plain HTTP
// daemon with OpenAI-style tool calling and NO agent harness — so this backend
// owns the whole agentic loop itself: it streams /api/chat NDJSON, dispatches
// tool calls, and feeds results back until the model produces a final answer.
//
// Local models can't survive the full ~200-schema comfyui surface plus ~40
// panel_* schemas, so the model sees exactly SIX tools (the "tool router"
// pattern from issue #97):
//   list_tools / describe_tool / call_tool      — passthrough to a headless
//     comfyui MCP subprocess spawned in COMPACT mode (3 meta-tools built in)
//   panel_list_tools / panel_describe_tool / panel_call_tool — synthesized
//     here over the orchestrator's loopback panel HTTP MCP (live-graph tools)

 * number a provider actually measures.
 *
 *   • Per-image is not per-request. A turn attaches up to 4 refs, and — the part
 *     that made #2221 permanent — `this.history` is built ONCE per session and
 *     never trimmed, so every image any turn ever attached is re-serialized onto
 *     every later request. The total only grows.
 *   • Raw bytes are not wire bytes. Both dialects ship base64, which is 4/3 the
 *     size, so 12 MB of PNG leaves here as ~16 MB.
 *
 * So the existing cap permits ~64 MB on the first turn alone and is unbounded
 * over a session. OpenRouter answers that with `http 413 {"error":{"message":
 * "Downloaded image content cannot exceed 30MB"}}`, and because history is
 * stable the next attempt rebuilds the identical payload — the session is
 * bricked, which is exactly what #2221 reported (three identical failures in
 * ~30s on a plain-text message that attached nothing).
 *
 * 30 MB is OpenRouter's documented ceiling and the default here. It is measured
 * on the BASE64 length rather than the decoded bytes deliberately: base64 is the
 * larger of the two, so a history under this budget is under the limit on either
 * reading. Other openai-compatible endpoints differ, hence the override.
 *
 * This is a ceiling, not a target — a single-image turn is nowhere near it, so

 * that never counted, on the workflow that is CORRECT: search once, then
 * read `details` for three or four candidate packs. The fourth would be
 * answered with "STOP searching" while the model is doing exactly the right
 * thing, and at eight the turn breaks. Same #839 shape as the download_model
 * case above, so the same remedy: key the ACTION, and count only the
 * keyword search.
 *
 * `list_tools` / `panel_list_tools` are the remaining instance of that fold
 * (#2429). Compact mode's protocol is to enumerate them — including walking
 * `list_tools {category:…}` across the catalog headings — and the
 * exact-repeat breaker already catches a wedged identical call. Counting
 * the bare name treats that walk as the Civitai-hunt wedge: four categories
 * get "STOP searching", eight kill the turn with repeats still at 1–2
 * (every category is a distinct args blob). Count them only when the call
 * carries a non-empty `search`; that is the hunt this counter exists for.
