// Panel agent — one persistent Claude Agent SDK streaming session per ComfyUI
// panel tab. This is the autonomous background driver for the sidebar panel: the
// orchestrator (src/orchestrator/index.ts) owns the UI bridge and feeds each
// tab's user messages into that tab's session here; the agent's replies flow
// back out to the panel chat.
//
// Why the Agent SDK (not --sdk-url / CCR-v2): we need a persistent background
// agent with a live "channel in" (push messages over time), interrupt/inject,
// and SUBSCRIPTION auth with no API key — without patching the claude binary.
// `query({ prompt: <async generator> })` is exactly that: the generator stays
// open (the channel in), `Query.interrupt()` stops a live turn, and with
// ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset the SDK reads the on-disk claude.ai OAuth login
// (verified: the session reports apiKeySource=none on this machine).
//
// The spawned agent runs THIS comfyui-mcp build as its MCP server in normal
// mode, so it talks to the live ComfyUI over COMFYUI_URL and never contends for
// the bridge port the orchestrator owns.
