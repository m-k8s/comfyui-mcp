 * after a `fetchApi` call is dead code, and the endpoint-specific answers behind
 * those checks have never once run. That is not a theoretical concern:
 *
 *   - `fetchImage`'s IMAGE_NOT_FOUND — added by #435 for issue #385 itself, naming
 *     the filename and pointing at the listing tool — never fired for a missing
 *     output file.
 *   - `getSetting` treats a 404 as "unset (frontend default applies)", because
 *     some ComfyUI builds 404 the per-id settings route. Those builds threw.
 *   - `loadLockFromLibrary` treats a 404 as "no lock present", which is the
 *     ORDINARY case for an unlocked workflow. It threw.
 *
 * This keeps the library's URL and header construction verbatim — `apiURL` adds
 * the api_base prefix and the clientId, `apiHeaders` adds comfy-user and merges
 * the caller's — so a proxied, prefixed or multi-user target resolves exactly as
 * before. The ONLY difference is that the Response comes back instead of being
 * turned into an exception, which is what lets the caller classify it.
 *
 * `userdataFetch` in services/userdata-library.ts arrived at this same shape
 * independently for one route (panel #202); this is that fix generalised.
 *
 * Not a replacement for `comfyuiFetch`: use that when you are composing the URL
 * yourself (as `getSystemStats` and `enqueuePrompt` do). Use this when you want
 * the library's routing and a Response you can read.
